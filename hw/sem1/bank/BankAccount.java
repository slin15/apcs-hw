/*
  0. Procure Thluffy's BankAccount from QAF, and make it your own.
  1. Modify your teamâ€™s BankAccount class with these new rules:
  The account number should only be set to a 9 digit number ( interval [100000000,999999998] ), if the parameter is invalid, set the account number to 999999999 and print a message to the screen about the problem.
  The PIN should only be set to a 4 digit number (some value between 1000 and 9998). If the argument is invalid, set the PIN to 9999 and print a message to the screen about the problem.
  Change withdraw so that if the account does not have enough money, nothing is changed, an error message is printed and false is returned. If the account does have enough money, then the amount is deducted and true is returned
  Write an authenticate method that takes as parameters an account number and a password, and returns true if the credentials are valid for this BankAccount object and false otherwise.
  2. Write a main() method as the last method in your class. Use it to test all of your methods via terminal output.
  Note: Avoid typecasting for now. If you are generating errors related to this, revert to using int, float...
  Tips/Guidelines:
  Test, test, TEST! Develop one bit of functionality at a time. Test it, then move on.
  Include heading (with team name and roster) and descriptive comments.
  Upload BankAccount.java to the homework server. (Each teammate should upload identical copy.)d
  Bring UML diagram representing final version to class.
