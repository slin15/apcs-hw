Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
I was really fascinated and rather delighted by the bubble theory and how what we see is really just a bubble amidst bubbles. It put humans in contrast to the universe and the infinite expanse of what we do not know, and I felt at ease.

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
I feel like I've taken pattern recognition and all that I know know for granted and that I should give thanks to my ancestors and to the universe and I just really really appreciate things right now.
